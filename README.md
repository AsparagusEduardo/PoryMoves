# PoryMoves

PoryMoves is a tool for use with the pret's [**Pokémon Emerald decompilation**](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) project.

It uses move data from multiple Pokémon games and lets the user customize which ones to use for their decomp hacks.


Thanks to [MandL27](https://github.com/MandL27) for their original export code.
